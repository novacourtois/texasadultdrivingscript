# texasadultdrivingscript
=====================================

[texasadultdriver.com/](http://www.texasadultdriver.com/) fulfills the writing section of your Texas driving license test.


It makes you wait some arbitrarily large amount of time on each slide, and if you click ahead it before the time runs out, it redirects you to a page telling you to wait. 

I wrote some small script that you can just pop into the console, run it, and get through the class without actually reading.
